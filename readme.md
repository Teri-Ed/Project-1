Overview/description of the project: 
    This is a personal resume page.  On my page there are four main files / links on the page.  The home page is my personal summary, the work expereince page provides details on my work expereience, the portfolio page is created to hold my web design projects (when I get there), and there is a contact me page.  
Details on how to use it or what functionality is offered: 
    To use my page you will use the navigation bar to move between the four separate pages.  You will get to each page by selecting the link on the nav bar.  The contact me page has a form that can be filled out to send out some contact information and inquiries.  There are also some links imbedded in each page including a link to my LinkedIn profile and links to previous employer websites.  
Technologies Used ( .html , .css ):
    .html, .css, .JavaScript
Ideas for future improvement (minimum of 3): 
    1. I would like to add more to my portfolio page.
    2. I would like to build the backend so that my form works.
    3. I would like to work on the design so that it is cleaner and easier on the eye.
